Section 1 - Design & Development
Q1
Could you outline what you would consider to be the important considerations If you were
asked to develop a web application that could potentially be used by athousands of users?

Answer:
My biggest consideration would be performance/speed. In my current role I spend a lot of time thinking about how to improve my queries to maximum speed of the websites I work on.  

Q2
What techniques do you employ to keep up-to-date with the rapid pace of progress in the
field frontend development? How do you choose which technologies are worth taking the
time to learn more about?

Answer:
I try to follow influential people in the field (Chris Coyier, Paul Irish, Robin Cornett to name a few) on twitter. I also use codecademy and lynda as well on my down time. 

If I feel like a certain technology can help me with something I am working on or do something faster than I feel like it's worth learning. I learn best when I have a practical use for the technology I'm trying to learn. However, take react.js I have no practical use for this in my role today but I know this is becoming one of the standard javascript frameworks so I'm using my free time to learn it. 

 

Section 2 - & Deployment
Q1
Describe the approach you take in testing your applications.

Answer:
I don't currently work on applications, I work on websites. I do cross browser testing in the actual browsers and on a small selection of devices and use virtual box to emulate the browser I don't have available to test on.
I also turn on PHP notices on my local environment to catch any issues before moving to production. 
For javascript code I use: http://jshint.com to fix and enhance any javascript code that is added to the site.
 
Q2
What do you value in a code base?

Answer:
Scalability. And comments, lots of comments.

Section 3 - General
Q1
What do you find most exciting or interesting about working in the software development
field?

Answer:
I've been on the website development side for a long time. I'm looking forward to a new challenge and learning techniques for coding web apps rather than content based websites.
 
Q2
In your career to date, what are you most proud of and why?

Answer:
I'm sure most people answer with a particular project they are proud of.  I do have many projects that am proud of where I may have solved a difficult technical challenge or a complex UX hurtle.  But the projects I have completed isn’t what I would say I am most proud of.
I started off my career as a graphic designer who got thrown into a web designer role, which then morphed into a developer role. Which each new role I have taken more technical challenges then with the last. I would say that I am most proud that I have been able to change my career path into something I really enjoy and that I continue to seek out new challenges everyday.
